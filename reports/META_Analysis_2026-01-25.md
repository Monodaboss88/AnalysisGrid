## Conclusion

META presents a **WAIT/YELLOW** signal heading into earnings week. While options flow is bullish and the longer-term trend remains intact, near-term technicals show caution with overbought RSI and price below the daily POC.

**Recommended Action:**
1. Avoid new positions until post-earnings clarity
2. If already long, consider trimming or hedging with puts
3. If playing earnings, size small (gap risk is real)
4. Best setups will emerge post-earnings when IV normalizes

**Key Levels to Watch:**
- **Bullish above:** $670 (daily VAH breakout)
- **Bearish below:** $640 (daily VAL breakdown)
- **Pivot:** $660 (max pain / options magnet)
